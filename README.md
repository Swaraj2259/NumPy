# ðŸš¦ Air Quality Spike Detection using NumPy (Terminal App)

A simple Python project to analyze daily Air Quality Index (AQI) readings using **NumPy**. This tool helps detect pollution spikes, compute rolling averages, and handle missing dataâ€”all through the terminal.


## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Take AQI data for any number of days from the user.
- âœ… Automatically handle missing values (`-1` treated as missing).
- âœ… Compute rolling averages (default window = 3 days).
- âœ… Detect sudden pollution spikes (if AQI changes sharply between consecutive days).
- âœ… All results printed directly in the terminal.


## ðŸ’» Tech Used

- **Python 3**
- **NumPy**



## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone or download this project.
2. Make sure **NumPy** is installed:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy


## Also the notes of the NumPy is there which i have make during the learning the NumPy.
